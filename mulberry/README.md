### Introduction


Addressing the House of Representatives on Thursday, February 24, 1831, Abel Wheeler, Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, reported that the power and wealth of France were mainly derived from silk production and that a number of other European countries had embarked on the same path "with zeal."[^1]  Conversely, the United States was spending a fortune on foreign silk: between 1821 and 1825 the total value of imported silk was worth approximately $945 million in today’s currency.[^2]  To further his point, Mr. Wheeler compared this vast sum to the revenue generated from US bread exports: a paltry $5 million a year, or about $180 million today. Not only could mulberry leaves—the food of silkworms—be transformed into stacks of cash, but the mulberry tree itself was undemanding, requiring neither good soil nor good climate.[^3] However, as we will discover, despite years of effort to establish sericulture in the U.S, Wheeler's dream of turning leaves into gold came to nothing.

>The only appropriate food for the silkworm is the leaf of the mulberry tree. It should be the first business therefore of the silk grower to provide himself with the source of a constant supply of mulberry leaves.[^4]

Here we tell the story of loss, but also one of renewal and metamorphosis. In the shadows of the fields haunted by white mulberries rose the canopies of another tree: Morus rubra, the red mulberry native to North America. While the red mulberry is found almost nowhere else in the world but North America, more often than not it is the white mulberry that comes to mind when we think of a mulberry tree. The white mulberry has captured attention throughout history, both within and outside its native ranges, overshadowing the red mulberry, even in its home continent.

The story of the red mulberry is a less glamorous one than that of the white mulberry and the dreams of riches promised by silk. It is a story earthier in its substance, more of root, trunk, and twig; bark and berry; and the breeze that gets caught in a generous canopy. These are the threads of Indigenous wisdom, landscapes of heritage and memory, in which the red mulberry is a horticultural marvel: a medicine chest, source of food, fiber, wood, and respite. Neglected and overlooked because it was not the favorite food of the silkworm, the red mulberry tree is reclaiming its legacy in the landscapes of North America. It may not be the money tree of silk production like the white mulberry, but as we will discover, every part of the tree offers wealth of its own kind.[^5]

Paragraph 9 Smooth and lustrous, silk has enchanted the wealthy all over the world for millennia. Imagine the wonder and delight of discovering the delicate threads that shone like silver. It’s no surprise that the silkworm itself was revered as an extraordinary organism with its ability to convert white mulberry leaves into precious filaments. Writing about the mysteries of animal husbandry in 1668, John Worlidge, an English agriculturalist, mused on the sublime powers of "This, though but a Worm, yet glorious Creature."[^15] Cleopatra was enamored with the billowing silk sails of her pleasure boat.[^16] Possibly because it was so ephemeral and delicate, in ancient Rome silk was considered too effeminate for men to wear. In the reign of the second Roman Emperor, Tiberius (42 BCE—37 CE), a law was passed "that no man should dishonor himself by wearing silken garments."[^17]

Paragraph 10 Silk is sacred in many cultures.[^18]  As is the mulberry tree. In cosmologies, myths, and legends, there is an aura of reverence for the mulberry tree. In Hindu-Buddhist cosmology for example, the divine Kalpavriksha is thought to be a white mulberry.[^19] The Romans considered the black mulberry sacred to Minerva.[^20] Sicilians still celebrate the Feast of St Nicholas by cutting a branch from the black and keeping it home for a year.[^21]

Paragraph 11Fame is surely secured by myths, art, and song, and the mulberry plays a prominent role in all three. In the Babylonian love story about Pyramus and Thisbe by the Roman poet, Ovid in the first century BCE, the lovers arrange to meet under a mulberry tree, most likely a black mulberry since the white mulberry was not present in Babylon as the time. Thisbe arrives first but runs away after a lion attacks her, leaving behind her bloodied scarf. When Pyramus arrives, he sees the scarf and, believing Thisbe to be dead, stabs himself. When Thisbe returns to the tree and sees her lover’s body, she ends her life. It is said their blood is what gave the berry its dark color.

Paragraph 12 Van Gogh painted a mulberry tree in 1889, one year before his death, in brushstrokes that pulsate with life, echoing perhaps his feverish state of mind during a stay at an asylum. More cheerful is the depiction in folklore where the mulberry tree inspires carousing songs, odes to its juicy fruit,[^22] and the tree around which children dance as they sing the popular nursery rhyme.[^23]

Paragraph 26 Present in the landscapes of our childhoods and imaginations, how was it that the mulberry tree transformed from the harbinger of wealth to a pest, by some accounts, even an invasive species? A key factor is "mulberry mania," which took hold of the northeastern United States in the 1830s. The fast-growing Morus multicaulis tree—a white mulberry variant that arrived in the United States from China, had immediate appeal. Its large leaves were easy to harvest and provided an abundant and nutritious source of food for silkworms. State subsidies encouraged the widespread planting of trees to supply an ever-increasing number of forays into silk production.[^56]

Paragraph 27 The hype spread from state to state: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia were early adopters,[^57] and Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut followed suit. Mulberry mania spread south to South Carolina.[^58]  Advertisements in newspapers and magazines promised buyers a ten-fold increase in trees and, therefore, in profits over just one season.[^59]  Millions of hastily raised white mulberry trees were sold, inflating a speculative bubble that burst just as the entire nation’s economy collapsed in the late 1830s.[^60] It seems true to say that the role of the leaves of the white mulberry in the failed economy of silk production tainted the tree itself.[^61]

>Nor is this tree less beautiful to the eye than the fairest elm, and is very proper for walks and avenues.[^62]

Paragraph 28 Horticulturists writing about the red mulberry use language that elevates the tree in words that suggest a patriotic pride in the species that is native to North America. A popular handbook from 1900 quotes Charles Sprague Sargent, author of the periodic survey of American trees, Silva of North America, who lists the many winning qualities of the red mulberry.[^63] Apart from a wide and dense canopy that provides abundant shade, "its freedom from disease and the attacks of disfiguring insects, its prolificness, its hardiness except in its earliest years, and the rapidity of its growth in good soil, make it a most desirable ornamental tree."[^64] Silva of North America 1892-1902 admires the red mulberry’s "shapely head" and remarks on it being a "venerable tree."[^65]

Paragraph 29 At Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden near Richmond, Virginia, a 100-year-old red mulberry is venerated and is a popular feature in its [Children’s Garden](https:www.lewisginter.org/a-giving-tree/). It's the only tree visitors are allowed to climb and harvest for berries. Websites devoted to native species and plant nurseries in the surrounding areas encourage gardeners to grow red mulberries, both for their fruit and the shade of their generous canopies. As summer temperatures continue to rise every year, these shade or cooling trees, in the vernacular of horticulture, become ever more alluring. In addition, they are also necessary for humans, birds, and insects as resting spaces, homes, and sources of nutritious berries.

Paragraph 30 During his travels around North America in the in the eighteenth century, the Swedish naturalist Pehr Kalm described the view of red mulberries on "fields, hills and near houses."[^66] The red mulberry was not only common in these landscapes of home, their timber was used to make homes. Red mulberry wood is weather- and insect-resistant and makes for fine cabinets and musical instruments.[^67] Its bark is suitable for "good and rough bast ropes."[^68] And it caters to birds, insects, and domestic animals. Species of birds that feed on the tree’s fruit include the yellow-billed cuckoo, kingbird, tree swallow, thrush, and warbler.[^69] In the southern states, the fruit of the red mulberry was good for fattening hogs and feeding poultry.[^70] Hardy and easy to grow, the red mulberry can be coppiced and pruned to make excellent hedges "keeping children in and animals out."[^71]

Paragraph 31 For centuries, people in different parts of the world have used mulberry trees for multiple purposes in both house and homestead. Settlers in the United States, including farmers and gardeners, discovered how adaptable the white and red mulberry tree were to being shaped for human convenience. White mulberry was pruned so that children and "aged women" could harvest its leaves.[^72] In Europe, Macedonian farmers selected and bred white mulberry trees to have broad leaves with low moisture and fiber content.[^73] In China, it was common to graft cultivated stock from the white mulberry onto established wild rootstock—five years later, the leaves were ready to harvest.[^74] Mulberry trees were so malleable that even their sex could be changed through simple grafting of a branch from a female tree onto a male tree.[^75]

Paragraph 32 Alongside the pruning, grafting, altering, and shaping to suit human needs, a different quality of relationship with the red mulberry co-evolved with Native American peoples. In his travelogue recounting his journeys through North American landscapes in the eighteenth century, Pehr Kalms wrote of the fruit bread he ate with the Iroquois peoples: it was "just like the puddings which our women pack full of raisins."[^76] The tree’s berries provided fruit, preserves, such as jams and syrups, as well as mulberry wine.

Paragraph 33 Plant knowledge extended to the medicinal properties of every part of the red mulberry tree from berry, leaf, twig, bark, and root. The Ozark-Ouachita Highlands peoples used the bark as a laxative.[^77] The Cherokee and Mohegan people applied its sap to the skin as a treatment for ringworm.[^78]  The acidity of mulberry juice as well as the leaves made a refreshing and cooling treatment for fevers, sore throats, and high blood pressure.[^79]

Paragraph 34 Observations recorded by Hernando de Soto in 1539 during his travels through Florida and the southeastern states include uses of the red mulberry by tribal communities.[^80] The Rappahannock treated ringworm by rubbing the sap onto affected areas. Drinking the liquor made by steeping its bark was a Cherokee remedy for constipation. In addition to food and medicine, the red mulberry also provided fiber and pigments for dyeing cloth. The Choctaws of northwestern Florida made cloth from its inner bark: Putting the bark in hot water and mixing it with ashes, the threads were woven into a coarse, hemp-like fabric.[^81]
